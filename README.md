# supernova

 Here's an example Python script that simulates a supernova and neutron star birth:
 ~~~
 import random

def simulate_supernova():
    """
    Simulates a supernova and returns the mass of the resulting neutron star.
    """
    # Generate a random mass between 8 and 30 solar masses
    mass = random.uniform(8, 30)
    # Calculate the kinetic energy released during the supernova
    energy = 1.2e46 * (mass / 15)**(5/3)
    # Calculate the mass of the neutron star based on the energy released
    ns_mass = (energy / (1.5e53))**(3/5) * 1.4
    return ns_mass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run a simulation and print the resulting neutron star mass
    ns_mass = simulate_supernova()
    print(f"Neutron star mass: {ns_mass} solar masses")
~~~
This script uses the mass-luminosity relation to generate a random mass for the star, calculates the kinetic energy released during the supernova using the energy-luminosity relation, and uses the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to calculate the mass of the resulting neutron star.

Here's an example test case for this script:
~~~
def test_simulate_supernova():
    """
    Test the simulate_supernova function by running it 1000 times and verifying that the
    resulting neutron star masses are within the expected range.
    """
    for i in range(1000):
        ns_mass = simulate_supernova()
        assert ns_mass >= 1.1 and ns_mass <= 2.2, f"Neutron star mass {ns_mass} is outside expected range"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_simulate_supernova()
~~~
This test case runs the simulate_supernova() function 1000 times and verifies that the resulting neutron star masses are within the expected range of 1.1 to 2.2 solar masses. If any mass falls outside this range, the test fails and prints an error message indicating the out-of-range mass.

To run the test case, save it to a file with a .py extension (e.g. supernova_test.py), and run the following command:
~~~
python supernova_test.py
~~~
This will run the test and output either nothing (indicating that the test passed) or an error message (indicating that the test failed).
